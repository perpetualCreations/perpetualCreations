#### Good morning, X! Welcome to your first day at ████████ Corporation!
- I write projects mostly in Python or C++, my portfolio is my sole web-developer project.
- I've ran server deployments on aging laptops and worked with microcontrollers (where I also picked up C).
- I can make a nice hardware enclosure for you project with FreeCAD.
- My electrical engineering is borderline psychotic. Expect sparks and shorted components.

#### You're probably disoriented, read the brochure on your desk about our business!
- I maintain a portfolio site with in-depth documentation on projects and occasional updates.
- The site is self-hosted. Please don't try to break it, I'm not exactly an InfoSec professional.
- Also Github Calendar on the site updates page will break mandatorily every few months when a Github front-end dev needs to scratch their re-design itch.

#### If you have any questions please send me an email, or contact HR!
- Send emails to attached address on profile.
- There's a 40% chance I forget to check it, and you'll be stuck waiting for a few days.
- I heard if you offer a Magnet program seat, you'll have better chances.
